It's not what Varys says.

He says Renly's army
is flocking to support Stannis,

94
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,844
which would give Stannis superiority

with your schemes and your plots?

160
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,535
-about what I saw in that cave.
-I thought I made it clear to you

161
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,953
there'd be no need to speak to me
on this matter.

162
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,038
Your Grace, I...

163
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,457
I've never known you to need
to hear a thing twice.

164
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,127
And I've never known you
to hide from the truth.

165
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,629
You've come to lecture me on truth?

166
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,047
I've come to tell you that what I saw...

167
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,299
All my brother's bannermen
have come to my side.

168
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,471
Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards.

169
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,515
They won't be able to resist us now.

170
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,225
Soon I shall be sitting on the lron Throne.

171
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,727
Nothing is worth what this will cost you,
not even the lron...

172
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,437
I'll hear no more about it.

secure the perimeter.

174
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,909
When do we sail for King's Landing?

175
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,245
As soon as I've consolidated my troops.

176
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,205
We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.

177
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,499
Once Blackwater Bay is cleared,

178
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,752
we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep
and take the city.

179
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,880
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?

180
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,175
That's not your concern.

181
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,804
lf you take King's Landing
with her by your side, the victory will be hers.

182
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,140
I never thought l'd have reason
to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

183
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,851
LoyaI service means telling hard truths.

184
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,186
Oh, truth again.

185
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,689
All right, what's the truth?

186
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,567
The hard truth?

187
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,446
She's a foreigner
preaching her foreign religion.

188
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,575
Some believe she whispers orders in your ear
and you obey.

189
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,371
What do you believe?

190
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,919
You won those bannermen from Renly.

191
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,547
Don't lose them to her.

192
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,305
We set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.

193
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,851
And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.

194
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,813
Your Grace, I'm honored,
but my time on the sea

195
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,483
was spent evading ships, not attacking them.

196
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,151
The other lords won't be happy.

197
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,237
Most of those lords
should consider themselves lucky

198
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,573
I don't hang them for treason.

199
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,745
Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.

203

Stannis has more infantry,
more ships, more horses.

204
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,735
What do we have?

205
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,446
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

206
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,991
Well, I've never actually been able
to kill people with it.

207
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,452
Good thing. l'd be out of a job.

208
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,621
What about your father?

209
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,249
He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.

210
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,918
He's very busy.

211
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,922
Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark
is time-consuming.

212
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,216
We won't be able to
hold the city against Stannis,

213
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,801
not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.

Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of kings

It's hard to argue with his assessment.

The king is a lost cause.

It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.

A dancing king,

They blame you for the city's ills.

I've got 30 ships.
There's nowhere to put them here.

Why aren't you with the rest of them?

273
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,103
Or did they send you to row me out
and dump me halfway in the sea?

274
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,480
That would be good for a laugh.

They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.

And how am I supposed to prove myself
by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?

You're not.

278
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:40,202
And yet that's the task my father has given me
to prove that I'm a true lron lslander.

279
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,996
They're all lron lslanders.

280
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,625
Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?

As soon as Winterfell got word
that we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

287
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,444
the Starks would send their men

288
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,279
And then...

289

Take me to my ship.

290
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,004
The Starks have overextended their lines.

291
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,923
Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time

292
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,842
keeping their men and horses fed.

293
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,010
The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.

The cold won't beat them.

Our spies report growing discontent
among the Northern lords.

296
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,272
They want to return home
and gather the harvest before the crops turn.

297
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,108
And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

298
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,152
they would report growing discontent
amongst the Southern lords.

299

This is war, no one's content.

We've underestimated
the Stark boy for too long.

301
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,956
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

302
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,627
And as long as he keeps winning battles,
they'll keep believing he is King in the North.

303
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,213
You've been waiting for him to fail.

304

My wife's in Lannisport.

312
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,158
Well, then you'd better start riding.

313
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,996
Go, before I change my mind
and send her your head.

314
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,123
lf your name wasn't Lannister,

315
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,835
you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!

316
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,840
Not wine, water.

317
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,842
We'll be here for some time.

318
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,140
Girl.

319
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,644
Where are you from?

320
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,520
Maidenpool, my lord.

321
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:17,067
And who are the Lords of Maidenpool?
Remind me.

322
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,945
House Mooton, my lord.

323
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,738
And what is their sigil?

324
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,119
A red salmon.

325
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,872
I think a MaidenpooI girl
would remember that.

326
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,042
You're a Northerner, aren't you?

327
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,380
Good. One more time, where are you from?

328
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,632
Barrowton, my lord.

329
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,592
House Dustin.

330
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,345
Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.

331
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,934
And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?

332
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,439
They call him the Young Wolf.

333
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,816
And?

334
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,194
They say he rides into battle
on the back of a giant direwolf.

335
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,534
They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.

336
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,577
They say he can't be killed.

337
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,539
And do you believe them?

338
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,583
No, my lord.

339
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,712
Anyone can be killed.

340
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,929
Fetch that water.

341
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,680
A girI says nothing.

342
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,061
A girI keeps her mouth closed.

343
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:22,150
No one hears,
and friends may talk in secret, yes?

344
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,448
A boy becomes a girl.

345
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,991
I was always a girl.

346
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,160
And I was always aware.

347
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,954
But the girI keeps secrets.

348
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,291
It is not for a man to spoiI them.

349
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,586
You're one of them now.

350
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,466
I should have let you burn.

351
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,554
And you fetch water for one of them now.

352
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:55,350
Why is this right for you and wrong for me?

353
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,770
-I didn't have a choice.
-You did.

354
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:00,814
I did.

355
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,399
And here we are.

356
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,154
A man pays his debts.

357
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,365
A man owes three.

358
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,825
Three what?

359
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,204
The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.

360
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,415
And only death may pay for life.

361
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,086
You saved me and the two I was with.

362
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,214
You stole three deaths from the Red God.

363
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,553
We have to give them back.

364
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,933
Speak three names

365
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,936
and the man will do the rest.

366
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,481
Three lives I will give you,

367
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,275
no more, no less,

368
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,651
and we're done.

369
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,820
I can name anyone

370
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,531
and you'll kill him?

371
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,409
A man has said.

372
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,913
The one who tortures everyone.

373
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,748
A man needs a name.

374
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,750
I don't know his name.

375
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,669
They call him the Tickler.

376
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,421
That is enough.

377
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,633
Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.

382
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,533
My uncle told me stories about him.

383
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,035
Most of them are true.

384
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,413
I heard the Halfhand
spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.

385
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,706
The whole winter.

386
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,250
He was north of the Skirling Pass
when the snows came.

387
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,211
Had to wait for the thaw.

388
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,964
So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.

389
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,259
Well, possible for the Halfhand.

390
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,136
Beautiful, isn't it?

391
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,722
Gilly would love it here.

Think of how old this place is.

00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,560
Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals,

399
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,105
before the Andals took Westeros
from the First Men.

Before I die, please, stop talking.

Thousands and thousands of years ago,

all through the long night.

What do you think they were like,
the First Men?

404

Stupid.

405
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,417
Smart people don't find themselves
in places like this.

406
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,627
I think they were afraid.

00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,048
I think they came here
to get away from something.

lf you could get reaI soldiers

which means fire inside the walls,

Thank you, my friend.

Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?

484
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,311
They say he's the weaIthiest man in Qarth.

485

It is known.

486

And if Qarth is the weaIthiest city in Essos...

487

The last time a rich man gave me a dress,
he was selling me to KhaI Drogo.

Only long enough
to tell Robb what I have seen.

After that, I will leave for Winterfell.

I've been away from them for far too long.

570
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,330
I never knew my mother.

571
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,124
I'm sorry.

572
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,961
My own mother died on the birthing bed

573
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,464
when I was very young.

574
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,345
It's a bloody business.

His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.

He's gone, Brienne.

You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.

Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.

591

I do not know your son, my lady.

592
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,659
But I could serve you, if you would have me.

00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,911
You have courage.

594

but, I don't know,

595

596
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:03,007
And I think that when the time comes,
you will not hold me back.

597
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,593
Promise me that you will not hold me back
from Stannis.

When the time comes,
I will not hold you back.

Then I am yours, my lady.

626

Torrhen's Square
is barely 40 leagues from here.

627
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:02,543
How can the Lannisters strike so far north?

628
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,462
Might be a raiding party led by the mountain.

629
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,548
Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.

630
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,799
We have to help them.

631
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,302
Most of the fighting men are away with Robb,
but I can gather 200 decent men.

632
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,637
Do you need so many?

633
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,515
lf we can't protect our own bannermen,
why should they protect us?

634
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,561
Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.

635
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,772
Won't take long, my lord.
Southerners don't do well up here.

He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.

That's not the same as being a liar.

645

Well, it's not far off.

646
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,270
So, you've been dreaming
of a three-eyed raven again?

647
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,984
ln the godswood,
you told me you didn't dream.

Now who's a liar?

649
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,491
What did you see in your dream?

650
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,913
Something bad?

651
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,624
Tell me, boy.

652
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,630
I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.

653
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,800
I saw waves crashing against the gates

654
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,638
and the water came flowing over the walls...

655
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,267
It flooded the castle.

656
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,022
Drowned men were floating here,

657
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,107
in the yard.

658
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,946
Ser Rodrik was one of them.

659
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,368
The sea is hundreds of miles away.

660
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:00,661
I know.

661
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,122
-It's just a stupid dream.
-I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.

Mance has gathered them all

They're almost ready to make their move.

Now he's one of them.

687

He's going to teach them
our way of doing things.

688

They'll hit us in force
and they won't run away when we hit back.

689
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,845
They're gonna be more organized than before,
more disciplined,

more like us.

691

So we need to be more like them,
do things their way.

Sneak in, kill Mance,

00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,184
Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

779
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,519
And if l'd listened to that advice
outside the gates of Qarth,

780
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,229
we'd all be dead by now.

781
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,483
I know the opportunity before you
seems like the last you'll ever have,

782
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:50,070
-but you must...
-Do not speak to me like I'm a child.

783
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,407
-I only want...
-What do you want?

784
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:56,534
Tell me.

785
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,246
-To see you on the lron Throne.
-Why?

786
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,623
You have a good claim.

787
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,917
A title. A birthright.

788
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,671
But you have something more than that.

789
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,217
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

790
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:15,470
You would not only be respected and feared,
you would be loved.

791
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,432
Someone who can rule and should rule.

792
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,519
Centuries come and go without
a person like that coming into the world.

793
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:28,608
There are times when I look at you
and I stilI can't believe you're real.

794
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,915
So what would you have me do,
as my advisor?

795
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,381
Make your own way.

796
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:54,592
Find your own ship. You only need one.

797
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:57,470
The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.

798
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,474
And how do I get the ship?

799
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,560
I'll find it for you.

800
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,312
A sound ship with a good captain.

801
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,279
I look forward to meeting him.

802
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:19,659
Khaleesi.

805
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,483
You should stand sideface.

806
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,567
Sideface?

807
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,070
Sideways.

808
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,447
Why?

809
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,365
Smaller target.

810
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,411
Am I fighting someone?

811
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,746
You're practicing for a fight.

812
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,374
You should practice right.

816
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,388
Go up there. Go and see where he felI from.

817
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,728
Go up the battlement.

818
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,696
Move away.

819
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,909
Stand back. He's dead.
