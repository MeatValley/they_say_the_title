is fight and fuck, fuck and fight.

Why not send 40 of me? Or an army?

Unlike most folks, you've actually got one.

36
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,170
Because I don't want to start a war.

37
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,202
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

38
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,481

53
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,685

You're the Master of Coin.
How do we pay them?

57
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,162
Well, House Tyrell could front the gold,
and the crown would pay us back in time,

58
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,289
or I'd have words with my daughter.

59
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,561
You've already given us too much.

60
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,843
No, we must arrange better terms
with the Iron Bank.

61
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,331
- Absolutely.
- In person.

62
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,961
Me?

63
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,963
We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank,

64

to show these bankers our respect.

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,690

I can think of no one more qualified.

No.

77

The old High Septon
would have asked the vintage.

78
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,123
I could say that our minds
are temples to the Seven,

79
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,521
and should be kept pure.

80
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,729
But the truth is, I don't like the taste.

81
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,241
Hmm.

82
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,241
How may I serve?

83
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,161

we hear of septs being burned,

the bodies of holy men
piled in the streets.

86
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,562
Wars teach people to obey the sword,
not the gods.

87
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,927
Perhaps the gods need a sword of their own.

88
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,610
In the days before the Targaryens,

89
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,042
the Faith Militant dispensed
the justice of the Seven.

90
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,682
Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed
more than two centuries ago.

91
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,162
If I explain their holy purpose
to my son, the king,

92
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,450
I have no doubt he will sign a decree
arming the believers you felt worthy.

93
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,005
An army that defends
the bodies and souls of the common people?

94
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,526

95
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,645

Too often, the wicked are the wealthiest,
beyond the reach of justice.

102

The king himself cannot always
punish those who deserve it most.

you'll have Ser Loras released?

00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,170
MAN 1: Bastard!

180
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,321
MAN 2: You're an abomination!

181
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,564
MAN 3: Born of sin!

182
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,885
WOMAN: Filthy bastard!

183
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,565
We'll find another way.

184
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,645
MAN 4: Abomination!

185
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,011
My queen?

186
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,847
There was no way
to free Ser Loras without violence.

187
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,966
You're the King of the Andals,

188
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,681
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
the Protector of the Realm,

189
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,889
and you let a band of fanatics
imprison your brother-by-law.

190
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,091
I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow.

191
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,924
Are you? When?

192
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,211
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

193
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,567
He was praying just now.

194
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,405
I have to send word to Grandmother.

195
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,250
Will you come back later?

196
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,042
I need to be with my family, Your Grace.

197
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,125
Of course.

198
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,847
(GRUNTING)

199
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,884
SELYSEI You think highly of this boy?

200
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,401
Good.

201
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,891
STANNIS: Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

202
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,170
And a bastard by some tavern slut.

203
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,050
Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.

204
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,884
I should have given you a son.

205
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,365
Not your fault.

206
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,885
Whose, then?

207
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,961
I gave you nothing but weakness

208
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,161
and deformity.

209
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,325
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

210
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,890
My lady.

211
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,086
Her father is the Lord's chosen king,

212
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,686
and her father's blood
runs through her veins.

213
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,162
You march on Winterfell soon?

214
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,528
We must to beat the snows.

215
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,288
Once before, you put your faith
in Ser Davos and left me behind.

216
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,848
I hope you won't make that mistake again.

217
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,126
I won't.

218
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,760
I need you.

219
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,241
You only need faith, my king.

220
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,610
And you. What do you need?

221
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,370
To serve my Lord.

222
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,851
(GRUNTING)

223
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,725
Lord Ashford.

224
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,609
Lady Caulfield.

225
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,925
Lord Smallwood.

226
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,051
I've never even heard of these people.

227
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,003
They haven't heard of you, either.

228
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,047
But we need men, and they have some.

229
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,410
How many men does this Lord Mayzen
have to send us?

230
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,887
More than Lord Wibberley.

231
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,521
- Not him.
- I know. I'm sorry.

232
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,250
But we need men and supplies,

233
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,450
and Roose Bolton's the Warden of the North.

234
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,646
He murdered my brother.

235
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,530
We swore to be the watchers on the Wall.

236
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,009
We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.

237
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,606
And we can't get more men
without help from the Warden of the North.

238
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,724
Apologies, my lady-

239
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,721
(DOOR CLOSES)

240
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,410
Lord Commander.

241
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,203
How can I help you?

242
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,362
Come with us when we ride south.

243
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,410
None of us know the
castle as well as you do.

244
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,087
Its hidden tunnels, its
weaknesses, its people.

245
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,841
Winterfell was your home once.

246
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,800
Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?

247
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,046
Castle Black is my home now.

248
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,569
The Night's Watch take no part
in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.

249
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,085
There's only one war.

250
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,684
Life against death.

251
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,003
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

252
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,082
You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

253
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,448
Forgive me. I don't trust in visions.

254
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,121
No visions. No magic.

255
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,766
Just life.

256
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,447
Do you feel my heart beating?

257
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,009
There's power in you.

258
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,927
You resist it, and that's your mistake.
Embrace it.

259
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,890
The Lord of Light made us male and female.

260
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,081
Two parts of a greater whole.

261
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,731
In ourjoining, there's power.

262
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,640
Power to make life,

263
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,246
power to make light,

264
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,322
and power to cast shadows.

265
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,050
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

266
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,525
Then we shouldn't tell him.

267
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,761
- I can't.
- Why?

268
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,681
I swore a vow.

269
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,410
I loved another.

270
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,167
The dead don't need lovers.

271
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,361
Only the living.

272
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,280
I know.

273
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,411
But I still love her.

274
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,609
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

275
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,721
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

276
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,487
Are you lonely?

277
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,521
Just bored.

278
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,002
My father used to tell me that boredom
indicates a lack of inner resources.

279
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,766
Were you bored a lot, too?

280
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,890
I know Castle Black
is no place for a child, but...

281
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,611
I like it. I thought I'd be left at home.

282
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,443
I know Mother didn't want to bring me.

283
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,720
Why do you say that?

284
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,729
She told me, "I don't want to bring you."

285
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,285
She shouldn't have said that.

286
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,289
Are you ashamed of me, Father?

287
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,166
When you were an infant,

288
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,171
a Dornish trader landed on Dragonstone.

289
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,323
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

290
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,122
He had even sewn a dress on it
in the colors of our house.

291
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,849
No doubt he'd heard of your birth
and assumed new fathers were easy targets.

292
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,323
I still remember how you smiled
when I put that doll in your cradle.

293
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,803
How you pressed it to your cheek.

294
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,647
By the time we burned the
doll, it was too late.

295
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,649
I was told you would die.

296
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,811
Or worse,

297
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,809
the greyscale would go slow.

298
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,043
Let you grow just enough to know the world
before taking it away from you.

299
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,691
Everyone advised me to send you
to the ruins of Valyria

300
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,962
to live out your short
life with the stone men,

301
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,884
before the sickness
spread through the castle.

302
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,449
I told them all to go to hell.

303
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,450
I called in every maester
on this side of the world.

304
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,569
Every healer. Every apothecary.

305
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,767
They stopped the disease
and saved your life.

306
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,364
Because you do not belong across the world
with the bloody stone men.

307
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,401
You are the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

308
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,044
And you are my daughter.

309
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,725
(WATER DRIPPING)

310
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,801
LITTLEFINGER:
I thought I might find you here.

311
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,290
Your Aunt Lyanna.

312
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,243
Father never talked about her,

313
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,604
but sometimes I'd find him down here
lighting the candles.

314
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,845
They say she was beautiful.

315
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,205
I saw her once.

316
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,443
I was a boy living with
your mother's family.

317
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,490
Lord Whent held a great
tourney at Harrenhal.

318
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,324
Everyone was there.

319
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,529
The Mad King, your father,

320
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,204
Robert Baratheon,

321
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,326
and Lyanna.

322
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,641
She was already promised to Robert.

323
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,531
You can imagine what it was like for me, a
boy from nowhere with nothing to his name,

324
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,207
watching these legendary men
tilting at the lists.

325
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,082
The last two riders were Barristan Selmy
and Rhaegar Targaryen.

326
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,841
When Rhaegar won,
everyone cheered for their prince.

327
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,843
I remember the girls laughing
when he took off his helmet,

328
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,127
and they saw that silver hair.

329
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,361
How handsome he was.

330
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,285
Until he rode right past his wife,

331
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,121
Elia Martell, and all the smiles died.

332
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,727
I've never seen so many people so quiet.

333
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,924
He rode past his wife,

334
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,281
and he lay a crown of winter roses
in Lyanna's lap.

335
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,885
Blue as frost.

336
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,891
How many tens of thousands had to die
because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

337
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,562
Yes, he chose her.

338
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,801
And then he kidnapped her and raped her.

339
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,491
Come.

340
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,651
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

341
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,126
You're dressed for riding.

342
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,201
I am.

343
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,724
Where are you going?

344
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,848
King's Landing.

345
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,490
King's Landing?

346
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,642
Cersei sent for me.

347
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,087
We mustn't let her sniff out any trouble.

348
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,970
You can't leave me here.

349
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,282
I know how hard it is
to live with people you despise.

350
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,407
Believe me.

351
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,406
But it won't be for long.

352
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,327
How do you know?

353
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,369
Stannis Baratheon garrisons
at Castle Black.

354
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,566
He'll march south to King's Landing
before the winter snows block his way.

355
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,042
But first, he has to take Winterfell.

356
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,441
- You don't know that.
- I do.

357
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,522
Once he liberates these lands
from the Boltons,

358
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,120
he'll rally your father's bannermen
to his cause.

359
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,728
With the North behind him,
Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.

360
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,723
You think he'll defeat the Boltons?

361
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,170
He has a larger army.

362
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,891
He's the finest military commander
in Westeros.

363
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,726
A betting man would
put his money on Stannis.

364
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,246
I am a betting man.

365
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,209
And if you're right?

366
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,282
Stannis takes Winterfell,

367
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,489
he rescues you from
the most despised family in the North.

368
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,530
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim,

369
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,046
he names you Wardeness of the North.

370
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,445
But I...

371
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,204
I wouldn't...

372
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,691
Wardeness of the North?

373
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,967
You are the last surviving Stark.

374
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,441
He needs you.

375
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,370
And what if you're wrong?
What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell?

376
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,131
Or he does, and the Boltons defeat him?

377
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,727
Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay,
and make him yours.

378
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,931
I don't know how to do that.

379
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,764
Of course you do.

380
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,604
He's already fallen for you.

381
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,770
His father frightens me.

382
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,410
He should. He's a dangerous man.

383
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,523
But even the most dangerous men
can be outmaneuvered.

384
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,487
And you've learned to maneuver
from the very best.

385
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,441
I'll return before too long.

386
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,329
You be strong without me.

387
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,202
The North will be yours.

388
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,925
Do you believe me?

389
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,088
I expect I'll be a married woman
by the time you return.

That would have been a shit way to die.

396
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,569
As far as I've seen, they're
all shit ways to die.

397
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,723
Aye, but your lot have
to give the singers a good ending.

398
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,644
I don't care
what's sung about me when I'm dead.

399
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,960
No?

400
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,043
Two knights off to rescue a princess.
Sounds like a good song to me.

401
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,525
Sounds like all the rest.

402
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,323
What about you?

403
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,641
What shit way would you choose?

404
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,045
In my own keep, drinking my own wine,
watching my sons grovel for my fortune.

405
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,761
How disappointing.

406
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,810
I thought you'd have
something more exciting planned.

407
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,166
I've had an exciting life.
I want my death to be boring.

408
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,764
How do you want to go?

409
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,241
In the arms of the woman I love.

410
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,001
She want the same thing?

411
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,685
Let's go.

412
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,242
The captain of that ship,
what was he, Braavosi?

413
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,049
JAIME: Pentoshi.

414
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,690
BRONN: And he's headed to Oldtown?

415
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,728
JAIME: As I said. Why?

416
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,448
What's to stop him
from docking down the coast,

417
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,166
and telling the locals
that Jaime Lannister is in Dorne?

418
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,730
A bag of gold.

419
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,050
I'm not sure you understand

420
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,691
how much people hate your family
in this part of the world.

421
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,603
It was a heavy bag.

422
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,490
And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.

423

How many do you think you can take?

427
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,922

Cooper. This is Darnell.

436
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,690
You're from King's Landing.

437
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,489
Accent gave me away?

439
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,487
Why are you here?

440
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,128
Our ship capsized in the night.
We managed to swim ashore.

441
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,122
It was a near thing, really.

442
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,402
Thought the sharks would get us.

443
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,362
There are no sharks in Dorne.

444
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,281
Could have sworn those were shark fins.

445
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,091

Without Doran, we have no army
to march against the Lannisters.

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,728
I was drunk through
most of the Small Council meetings,

533
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,529
but it's all coming back.

534
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,769
You passed notes to Varys' little birds.

535
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,960
She found out, didn't she?

536
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,281
Found out and exiled you.

537
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,683
Now you hope to
win back her favor with a gift.

538
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,611
Risky scheme.

539
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,000
One might even say desperate.

540
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,849
You think Daenerys will execute me
and pardon you?

541
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,760
I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

542
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,281
(BIRD SCREECHES)

543
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,125
Everyone looks happy enough from up here.

544
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,650
- (LAUGHING)
- What?

545
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,728
I was thinking about all
the times your brother

546
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,247
made me go with him down from the Red Keep
into the streets of King's Landing.

547
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,164
- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people.

548
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,810
He liked to sing to them.

549
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,767
He sang to them?

550
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,524
- Yes.
- (LAUGHS)

551
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,530
Rhaegar would pick a spot on the Hook,
or the Street of Seeds, and then he'd sing.

552
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,931
Just like all the other minstrels.

553
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,161
And what did you do?

554
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,005
I made sure no one killed him.

555
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,325
And I collected the money.

556
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,402
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

557
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,488
- He was good?
- He was very good.

558
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,800
Viserys never told you?

559
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,406
He told me Rhaegar
was good at killing people.

560
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,285
Rhaegar never liked killing.
He loved singing.

561
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,331
And what did you do with the money?

562
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,688
Well, one time, he gave it
to the next minstrel down the street.

563
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,240
One time, he gave it
to an orphanage in Flea Bottom.

564
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,047
One time, we got horribly drunk.

565
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,446
(BOTH LAUGHING)

566
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,567
DAARIO: Your Grace.

567
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,688
Hizdahr is here,
waiting in the audience chamber.

568
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,607
How many others are there?

569
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,805
Fifty? 100?

570
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,564
Will you be joining us?

571
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,366
I think I can protect you
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

572
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,886
I think I can protect me
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

573
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,050
Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.

574
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,404
Your Grace.

575
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,802
All men must die, but not
all can die in glory.

576
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,928
- Glory?
- Why else do men fight?

577
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,722
Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea
and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

578
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,326
So their names would live on.

579
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,244
Those who find victory in the fighting pits
will never become kings,

580
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,368
but their names will live on.

581
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,283
It's the best chance they'll ever have.

582
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,850
Is that what you used to tell men

583
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,810
before you set them
to butchering each other for sport?

584
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,690
Today is the traditional start
of the fighting season.

585
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,489
I do not recognize this tradition.

586
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,683
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city,

587
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,205
your city, together.

588
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,808
Without them, former slaves and
former masters have nothing in common.

589
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,082
Nothing but centuries
of mistrust and resentment.

590
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,802
I can't promise
this is the answer to all our problems,

591
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,930
but it's a start.
