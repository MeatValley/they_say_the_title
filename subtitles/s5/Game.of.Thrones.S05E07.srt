to kneel before the gods.

360
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,610
Don't spar with me, little fellow.

361
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,641
(GROANS)

362
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,447
For me, it's the knees.

363
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,649
- You?
- Hips.

364
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,161
Ah.

365
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,611
A man of the people. Is that your game?

366
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,487
It's an old game. Dull and unconvincing.

367
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,011
A man of the people

368
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,331
who does Cersei's dirty work for her.

369
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,362
The people always do the dirty work.

370
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,569
Spare me the homilies.
I can smell a fraud from a mile away.

371

Useful talent.

I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.

373
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,847
Your grandson and granddaughter
swore sacred vows and lied.

374
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,121
The Father judges us all.

375
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,882
Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen.

376
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,564
If you break his laws,
you will be punished.

Don't you walk away from me.

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,768
You don't give commands here.

379
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,285
What is it you want?

380
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,200

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,405
I'll make you the richest septon
who ever lived.

383
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,246
What, then?

384
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,488
I imagine this is strange for you.

385
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,566
Everyone you meet has a hidden motive,
and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.

386
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,649
But I'm telling you a simple truth.

387
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,685
I serve the gods.

388
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,883
The gods demand justice.

389
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,447
How do they communicate their demands?

390
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,126
By raven or horse?

391
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,851
By the holy text, The Seven-Pointed Star.

392
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,962
If you don't have one in your library,
I'll give you my own.

393
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,566
I've read The Seven-Pointed Star.

394
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,964
Then you'll remember the passages
concerning buggery and perjury.

395
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,283
Your grandchildren will be punished

396
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,002
in the same manner
as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.

397
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,881
Half the men, women, and children
in this foul city break the sacred laws.

398
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,329
You live among murderers,
thieves, and rapists,

399
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,804
and yet you punish Loras
for shagging some perfumed ponce,

400
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,042
and Margaery for defending her brother?

401
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,531
Yes.

402
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,446
The gods' laws must be
applied to all equally.

403
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,248
If it's equality you want, so be it.

404
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,285
When House Tyrell stops sending our crops
to the capital,

405
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,563
everyone here will starve.

406
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,641
And I'll make sure
the hungry know who's to blame.

408
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,531
Have you ever sowed the field?

409
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,370
Have you ever reaped the grain?

410
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,565
Has anyone in House Tyrell?

411
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,562
A lifetime of wealth and power
has left you blind in one eye.

412
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,966
You are the few,

413
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,730
we are the many.

414
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,927

no matter how strong you
are, sooner or later,

you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.

Events you couldn't possibly have
anticipated or prevented, even if you had.

425
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,601
You cannot blame yourself for fate.

Hold them as they left this world.

Kissed their heads after they'd gone.

431
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,923
I'll call in the army.

432
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,564
I'll take back the sept,
and kill every last one of them.

433

I'll start a war if I have to.

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,327
You know as well as I do who the
first casualty of that war would be.

and I can't help her.

438
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,723
We must be strong for those we love.
We cannot give in to despair.

I will speak with the High Sparrow.

I'm sorry for that.

Why is it happening at all?

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,606
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.

536
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,971
It felt like the safest place.

537
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,722
Not for your clientele, clearly.

538
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,801
It was an establishment like no other.

539
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,162
The sheer range of appetites catered to.

540
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,169
Desires that didn't even exist

541
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,650
until we invented them.

542
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,164
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

543
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,165
The past is the past.

544
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,922
The future is all that's worth discussing.

545
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,045
The future of House Tyrell.

546
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,771
Don't pretend to have any concern
for my house,

547
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,569
my grandchildren, or me.

548
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,089
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

549
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,686
as soon as things started to go wrong.

550
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,967
- I promise you...
- I promise you, Lord Baelish,

551
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,890
that our fates are joined.

552
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,770
Together we murdered a king.

553
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,329
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

554
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,647
And if I should meet with some accident
here at your broken little flesh market,

555
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,126
they'll never even find what's left of you.

556
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,725
So...

557
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,050
Do you deny a part in all this?

558
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,291
Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.

559
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,081
I dared not refuse her.

560
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,010
And what did she want?

561
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,726
A piece of information she knew that I had.

562
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,204
Neither silence nor lies were an option.

563
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,645
But I have other information

564
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,925
of which she is unaware.

565
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,284
And as you say, our interests are aligned.

566
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,806
I have a gift for you.

567
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,771
What kind Of gift?

568
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,770
The same kind I gave Cersei.

569
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,005
A handsome young man.

570
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,723
YEZZAN: Many worthy fighters have died
trying to make it to the great games.

571
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,410
When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,

572
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,404
it will represent a significant rise
in your station.

573
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,645
But if you do happen to triumph here,

574
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,964
you will fight at the Great Pit of
Daznak itself, in front of the queen.

575
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,926
So whatever happens,
the gods have smiled upon you today.

576
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,765
This is the day your lives
actually start to mean something.

Sitting through the great games
will be bad enough.

584

For generations,
in the days leading up to the great games,

585
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,648
it has been customary for our ruler
to make the rounds of the lower pits

586

the honor of her presence.

So much weighing him down.

709
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,283

00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,649
he will float through
the seven heavens like a bird.

714
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,041
Hmm.

715
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,927
And he has much to say about you.

716
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,447
(DOOR OPENS)

717
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,121
(DOOR CLOSES)

718
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,921
Move.

719
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,527
Let me go immediately.

720
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,322
You will order her to let me go.

721
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,286
I am the queen!

722
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,044
Have you lost your mind?

723
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,481
Let me go!

724
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,001
...your filthy hands off me!
Are you out of your mind?

725
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,406
I am the queen! Let me go!

726
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,365
Look at me.

727
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,565
Look at my face.

728
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,205
It's the last thing you'll
see before you die.
