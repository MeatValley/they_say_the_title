00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,011
- It's a threat.
- Of course it's a threat.

186
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,250
Our daughter's alone in Dorne
surrounded by people who hate our family.

187
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,482
"It's a threat."

188
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,081
No note?

189
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,209
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister

190
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,443
and every other tragedy
that's befallen their cursed country.

191
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,000
I will burn their cities to the ground
if they touch her.

192
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,889
- Softer.
- What?

193
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,961
Not so loud.

194
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,884
Our daughter's in danger
and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly?

195
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,247
The world can't know she's our daughter.

196
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,927
Then don't call her your daughter.

197
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,530
You've never been a father to her.

198
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,080
If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the street.

199
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,202
And what has your caution brought?

200
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,724
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

201
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,207
Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne.

202
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,764
Our baby boy set to marry
that smirking whore from Highgarden.

203
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,921
I'm going to make things better.

204
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,490
You've never made anything better.

205
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,042
I'm going to Dorne
and I'm bringing our daughter home.

206
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,121
(SCOFFS)

207
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,961
You can't just ask Prince Doran
to give her back.

208
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,405
She's promised to his son.

209
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,406
I'm not going to ask him anything.

210
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,482
You go down there with an army,
it's an act of war.

211
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,289
No army.

212
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,521
Do you know where they're keeping her?

213
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,404
- Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
- I'll find her.

214
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,923
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

215
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,127
(CHUCKLES)

216
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,804
You're going to Dorne?

217
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,367
A one-handed man, alone.

218
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,602
I never said I was going alone.

219
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,365
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

220
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,602
Roses are very nice. Definitely roses.

221
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,366
And music. I adore music.
But no flutes. I hate flutes.

222
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,488
We can have a harp if you
like, but no flutes.

223
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,881
Then there's the food.
Food is the most important thing.

224
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,531
Don't you agree?
We're going to need pigeon pies.

225
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,807
That's what they eat in
the capital, don't they?

226
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,004
Don't they?

227
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,327
Don't who?

228
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,370
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

229
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,529
They certainly do, my dear.

230
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,121
It's a fine place, isn't it?

231
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,645
A fine place.

232
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,291
I never thought I'd end up
settling down in a place like this.

233
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,966
You won't.

234
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,041
Pardon?

235
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,088
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

236
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,448
When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

237
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,931
She hates me.

238
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,321
She calls me mean names,
and sometimes, even still,

239
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,290
she pulls my hair when
Mother's not looking.

240
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,842
You know what I think?

241
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,048
I think you're a good person.

242
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,122
And your sister is a mean person.

243
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,690
She is.

244
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,603
I've been all over the world,

245
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,728
and if there's one thing I've learned,

246
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,962
it's that meanness comes around.

247
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,809
People like your sister,

248
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,362
they always get
what's coming to them eventually.

249
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,408
One way or another.

250
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,204
Who's that?

251
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,162
Jaime fucking Lannister.

252
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,810
- Ser Jaime.
- Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

253
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,480
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

254
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,005
Thank you.

255
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,125
This is my betrothed, Lollys.

256
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,886
A pleasure.

257
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,404
Run along, love.

258
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,802
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

259
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,004
When were you planning on getting married?

260
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,401
- Just get on with it.
- On with what?

261
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,970
What you're here for.

262
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,970
There's no way this little visit could
possibly mean anything good for me.

263
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,084
It's very good for you.

264
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,243
- Lollys will be marrying Ser Willis Bracken.
- Mmm.

265
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,641
We made a deal, your sister and I.

266
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,241
I would have advised against that.

267
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,761
How is this good for me?

268
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,969
'Cause you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

269
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,485
And when we return,

270
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,087
I'm going to give you a much better girl
and a much better castle.

271
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,282
Return from where?

272
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,562
As far south as south goes.

273
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,962
TRYSTANE: My future queen.

274
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,803
(SPEAKING SOFTLY)

275
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,723
You are beautiful.

276
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,768
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

277
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,688
Remove yourself from my path or I'll take
that long ax and I'll shove it up your...

278
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,330
DORAN: Captain.

279
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,007
Let her pass.

280
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,807
Your brother was murdered,

281
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,329
and you sit here in the Water Gardens,
staring at the sky and doing nothing.

282
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,610
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.
By law, that is not murder.

283
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,081
- Your brother.
- You don't have to remind me.

284
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,004
He was my brother
long before he was anything to you.

285
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,006
What will you do about his death?

286
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,606
I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

287
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,727
And then?

288
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,285
You would have me go to war?

289
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,725
The whole country would have you go to war.

290
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,644
Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.

291
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,884
The Sand Snakes are with me.

292
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,650
They have the love of their people.

293
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,443
They will avenge their father while
you sit here in your chair doing nothing.

294
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,691
Oberyn is dead,

295
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,565
and this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens,

296
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,446
eating our food, breathing our air.

297
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,646
How many of your brothers and sisters
do they have to kill?

298
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,765
Let me have her.

299
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,327
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

300
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,122
I loved my brother.

301
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,402
And you made him very happy.

302
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,610
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

303
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,088
But we do not mutilate little girls
for vengeance.

304
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,445
Not here.

305
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,171
Not while I rule.

306
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,643
And how long will that be?

307
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,922
DAARIO: The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

308
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,290
Anyone can see you coming from a mile off.

309
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,283
Of course you haven't found
any Sons of the Harpy.

310
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,763
You haven't, have you?

311
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,841
(GRUNTS)

312
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,524
My Second Sons, on the other hand,

313
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,331
they drink, whore,

314
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,209
fight in the streets,

315
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,691
they blend in.

316
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,161
They overhear things in taverns,

317
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,926
follow people to nice, quiet alleys,

318
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,048
break a few fingers,

319
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,849
overhear a few more things.

320
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,124
Before you know it...

321
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,601
No one here.

322
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,285
We go.

323
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,125
In a hurry? You're afraid?

324
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,168
Unsullied fear nothing.

325
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,685
Right.

326
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,131
That's your problem.

327
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,171
You understood fear once long ago,
but you've forgotten what it means.

328
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,526
Someone who's forgotten fear

329
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,610
has forgotten how to hide.

330
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,321
(MAN SCREAMS)

331
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,121
(GROANS)

332
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,887
Fear is useful that way.

333
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,721
(SCREAMS)

334
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,323
Sons of the Harpy,
they want to put a collar back on my neck.

335
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,083
On all of our necks.
Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.

336
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,446
It would send a message.

337
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,161
I think you should exercise restraint,
Your Grace.

338
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,287
Why?

339
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,084
For one thing,
he may have valuable information.

340
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,050
The Son of the Harpy
has no more valuable information.

341
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,440
How do you know that?

342
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,443
Because I questioned him.

343
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,042
HIZDAHR: And the information you did get,
he is young and poor.

344
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,161
He is born free.

345
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,481
Why should he want to bring back slavery?
What did it do for him?

346
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,925
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride

347
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,849
was knowing that
there was someone lower than he was.

348
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,967
They pay him.

349
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,123
Great families afraid to do a thing.

350
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,931
They pay poor men to do it for them.

351
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,843
- And how do you know this?
- Everyone know this.

352
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,968
I don't know it,
and I'm the head of a great family.

353
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,361
BARRISTAN: We do not know
what this man did or didn't do.

354
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,001
Give him a trial at least. A fair trial.

355
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,285
Show all the citizens of Meereen

356
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,761
that you're better than
those who would depose you.

357
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,921
Teach them a better way.

358
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,447
I do not know the place
from where Old Ser comes.

359
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,923
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

360
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,002
But here in Meereen,

361
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,004
before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us.

362
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,401
So we learn much about them,

363
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,608
or we do not live long.

364
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,808
They teach me what they are.

365
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,125
Mercy, fair trial, these
mean nothing to them.

366
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,441
All they understand is blood.

367
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,762
DAENERYS: Thank you all for your counsel.

368
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,721
Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.

369
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,491
- About what?
- About your father.

370
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,528
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

371
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,125
You're here to remind
me of my enemies' lies?

372
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,486
Consider me reminded.

373
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,449
Your Grace,

374
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,000
I served in his Kingsguard.

375
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,605
I was at his side from the first.

376
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,122
Your enemies did not lie.

377
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,251
Go on.

378
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,805
When the people rose in revolt against him,

379
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,407
your father set their
towns and castles aflame.

380
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,802
He murdered sons in front of their fathers.

381
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,201
He burned men alive with wildfire

382
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,009
and laughed as they screamed.

383
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,642
And his efforts to stamp out dissent

384
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,044
led to rebellion
that killed every Targaryen except two.

385
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,685
I'm not my father.

386
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,525
No, Your Grace. Thank the gods.

387
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,530
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

388
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,400
And each time,
it made him feel powerful and right.

389
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,051
Until the very end.

390
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,880
I will not have the Son of the Harpy
executed without a fair trial.

391
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,482
Your Grace.

392
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,365
- (NEIGHING)
- (BLEATING)

393
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,046
There's a bug.

394
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,610
Yes, best be careful.

395
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,490
You might accidentally
consume some solid food.

396
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,361
When I agreed to come with you,
did I misrepresent my intentions?

397
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,766
Besides,

398
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,482
what else is there for me to do
inside this fucking box?

399
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,607
You don't like it?

400
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,728
- I want to take a walk.
- You can't.

401
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,447
Cersei has offered a lordship
to the man who brings her your head.

402
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,488
She ought to offer her cunt.

403
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,767
Best part of her for the best part of me.

404
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,491
Well, I suppose a box
is as good a place for me as anywhere.

405
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,206
Are we really going to
spend the entire road to Volantis

406
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,282
talking about the futility of everything?

407
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,566
You're right. No point.

408
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,483
The road to Volantis?

409
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,530
You said we were going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

410
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,011
The road to Meereen.

411
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,562
And what do you hope to find
at the end of the road to Meereen?

412
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,842
I told you. A ruler.

413
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,206
We've already got a ruler.

414
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,731
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

415
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,124
Every pile of shit on the side of every
road has someones banner hanging from it.

416
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,451
You were quite good, you know, at ruling.

417
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,484
During your brief tenure as Hand.

418
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,085
I didn't rule. I was a servant.

419
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,527
Still, a man of talent.

420
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,085
Managed to kill a lot of people.

421
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,131
Yes, but you showed great promise
in other areas as well.

422
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,410
She wanted me to leave King's Landing.

423
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,609
She begged me.

424
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,841
I wouldn't go.

425
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,481
Why?

426
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,050
'Cause I liked it.

427
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,729
Power.

428
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,882
Even as a servant.

429
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,042
People follow leaders.

430
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,521
And they will never follow us.
They find us repulsive.

431
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,926
I find us repulsive.

432
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,923
And we find them repulsive,

433
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,288
which is why we surround ourselves
with large, comfortable boxes

434
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,486
to keep them away.

435
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,488
And yet,

436
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,767
no matter what we do,

437
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,243
people like you and me
are never really satisfied inside the box.

438
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,924
Not for long.

439
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,929
You're right.

440
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,321
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

441
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,609
How many dwarves are there in the world?

442
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,365
Is Cersei going to kill them all?

443
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,685
(FLY BUZZING)

444
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,845
Not him.

445
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,849
Are you trying to deceive your queen?

446
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,601
Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?

447
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,806
That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.

448
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,210
I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.

449
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,805
Mistakes will be made.

450
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,609
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thank you, Your Grace.

451
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,324
- Take the head.
- Pardon me, Your Grace.

452
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,402
I would take it, if you don't mind.

453
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,721
It could prove useful for my work.

454
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,761
Very good.

455
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,248
Over there will be fine.

456
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,560
You heard the man. Over there.

457
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,201
(DOOR CLOSES)

458
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,725
You're the Hand of the King?

459
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,290
No, Unde.

460
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,046
Clearly it would not be appropriate
for a woman to assume that role.

461
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,168
I'm merely advising my son
until he comes of age

462
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,844
and chooses a Hand for himself.

463
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,364
Your Grace,
I would be willing to serve provisionally

464
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,602
as the King's Hand
until he becomes old enough...

465
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,125
You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

466
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,605
but I don't imagine you'll have the time.

467
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,527
In addition to being Master of Ships,

468
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,331
the king has appointed you Master of Coin.

469
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,967
Oh, Your Grace.

470
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,442
He called your experience and wisdom
in financial matters unparalleled.

471
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,211
He said he would be honored to have you
represent the crown's interests in the same.

472
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,282
The honor is all mine, Your Grace.

473
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,643
Your Grace, in the past
on several occasions,

474
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,246
a grand maester has served
as the King's Hand.

475
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,120
The king has named Qyburn
the new Master of Whisperers.

476
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,731
Your Grace, him? This man?

477
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,009
This embarrassment to the Citadel?

478
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,086
Your Grace, what qualifications
can he possibly have for this post?

479
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,282
The qualification of
loyalty, Grand Maester.

480
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,888
That's far more than the eunuch ever had.

481
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,482
Far more than many ever have.

482
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,323
I must say, I cannot see...

483
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,724
Uncle Kevan, in light of your position
as commander of the Lannister armies,

484
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,322
it would please the king
if you would serve as his Master of War.

485
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,563
No man living better deserves the title.

486
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,842
That is kind of you to say.

487
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,207
I would like to hear it
from the king himself.

488
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,566
The king is very busy at this moment.

489
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,081
He should be here
learning what it means to rule.

490
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,605
He is learning.

491
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,368
On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler,
he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

492
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,127
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects to my brother.

493
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,289
And to you. And to serve the king.

494
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,250
I did not return to serve as your puppet.

495
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,646
To watch you stack the Small Council
with sycophants.

496
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,771
Sending your own brother away
so he wouldn't be...

497
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,610
My brother has left the capital to

498
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,923
lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.

499
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,001
What mission?

500
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,845
That is not your concern as Master of War.

501
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,566
I do not recognize your authority
to dictate what is and is not my concern.

502
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,169
You are the Queen Mother, nothing more.

503
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,611
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

504
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,963
If he wants to send for me,
I will be waiting for him.

505
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,043
At Casterly Rock.

507
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,120
SHIREEN: Come on, you know this one.

508
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,529
It looks like an animal.

509
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,043
Snake.

510
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,208
Snake. S.

511
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,926
- It's an S.
- Right, very good.

512
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,041
Huh!

513
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,049
Did you know that the youngest
Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark,

514
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,690
was elected at the age of 10?

515
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,603
I know S.

516
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,330
You'll learn, I promise.

517
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,483
I taught Ser Davos, and old people
are terrible at learning new things.

518
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,688
Well, you're a wonderful teacher.

519
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,406
Very patient.

520
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,290
I only said that the more time
that you spend practicing,

521
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,566
the faster you'll be able to read.

522
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,450
That's all right. We're doing just fine.

523
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,481
I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
have a lot to talk about.

524
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,247
How old were you
when you learned how to read?

525
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,810
- Three.
- Three?

526
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,291
Who taught you, your mother?

527
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,124
No, old Maester Cressen did.

528
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,690
I had a lot of time to practice.

529
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,922
My mother kept me inside because...

530
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,411
What do you call it in the south,
what happened to your face?

531
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,403
Greyscale.

532
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,289
What do you call it north of the Wall?

533
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,769

But two of my sisters had it.

535
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,724
They both died.

What happened to your sisters?

541
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,161
My father made them move out of the keep
into the hut outside.

542
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,447
None of us were allowed to go near them.

543
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,007
But we heard them, especially at night.

549
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,811
They acted like animals.

550
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,529
My father had to drag them
out to the woods on a rope.

I'm teaching her to read.

She's a wildling.
Your father defeated her people.

He executed their king for treason.

You prevented that order

Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos
how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.
