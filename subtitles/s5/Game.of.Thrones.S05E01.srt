182
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,843
- JON: Shield up.
- ALLISER: These men need a firm hand.

183
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,687
Always have.

184
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,645
They're poachers and thieves.

185
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,289
Not soldiers.

186
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,007
That one hates me.

187
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,241
SAMWELL: If Ser Alliser is chosen
as the new Lord Commander...

188
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,811
- He hates the wildlings.
- (BABY CRYING)

189
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,645
All the wildlings.

190
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,882
- Don't let them send us away.
- It's not a sure thing.

191
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,770
Ser Denys Mallister has commanded
the Shadow Tower for 20 years,

192
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,560
And people say he's a good man.
He's running against Ser Alliser...

193
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,001
Sam, don't let them send us away.

194
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,249
I told you.

195
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,802
Wherever you go, I go, too.

196
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,042
You can't leave. They'll execute you.

197
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,890
Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.

198
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,761
Shield up.

199
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,488
The king wants a word.

200
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,481
(CHAINS RATTLING)

201
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,282
(WIND HOWLING)

202
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,921
You're not cold, my lady?

203
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,324
Never.

204
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,084
The Lord's fire lives within me, Jon Snow.

205
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,361
Feel.

206
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,967
Are you a virgin?

207
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,131
No.

208
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,486
Good.

209
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,171
Your Grace.

210
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,406
The bastard of Winterfell.

211
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,963
You know who rules at Winterfell now?

212
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,566
Roose Bolton.

213
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,730
Hmm. The traitor who plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

214
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,565
Don't you want to avenge him?

215
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,202
I want a great many things, Your Grace.

216
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,408
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

217
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,850
I've been talking to your sworn brothers.

218
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,570
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

219
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,324
DAVOS: Many don't.

220
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,440
You were seen taking the body
of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

221
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,046
Why?

222
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,690
It's where she belonged.

223
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,082
Some of the Night's Watch feel you have
too much affection for the wildlings.

224
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,323
They were born on the
wrong side of the Wall.

225
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,164
That doesn't make them monsters.

226
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,321
STANNIS: No matter.

227
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,971
I shall take back the North
from the thieves who stole it.

228
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,651
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

229
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,805
I shall mount Roose
Bolton's head on a spike.

230
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,763
But if I'm to take
Winterfell, I need more men.

231
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,806
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part...

232
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,928
I'm not talking about
the damn Night's Watch.

233
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,929
I'm talking about the wildlings.

234
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,125
Your Grace,

235
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,762
you want the wildlings
to march in your army?

236
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,569
If they swear to follow
me, I'll pardon them.

237
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,687
We'll take Winterfell.

238
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,491
Once the North is won,
I'll declare them citizens of the realm.

239
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,891
I'll give them land to live on.

240
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,128
It's a fair offer. More than fair.

241
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,089
I'll offer them their
lives and their freedom

242
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,130
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

243
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,641
I don't think that's likely.

244
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,281
STANNIS: You admire him, don't you?

245
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,850
I respect him.

246
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,160
He likes you.

247
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,403
- Convince him to bend the knee, or he burns.
- Your Grace.

248
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,891
How much time do I have?

249
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,360
STANNIS: Nightfall.

250
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,847
The sun drops fast this time of year.

251
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,684
Hurry, Jon Snow.

252
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,967
MAN: Shield up.

253
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,523
- (ROBIN WHIMPERING)
- MANI Attack, my lord!

254
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,244
- MAN: Attack!
- (ROBIN GROANING)

255
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,967
MAN: Don't cross your feet.

256
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,769
My sons had swords in their hands
from the time they could walk. This one...

257
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,043
LITTLEFINGER: Lord Arryn
will never be a great warrior.

258
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,963
ROYCE: Great warrior?

259
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,651
He swings a sword like a girl with palsy.

260
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,887
My lord.

261
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,410
MAN: Sword up, my lord!

262
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,849
LITTLEFINGER: Some boys
develop more slowly.

263
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,127
He's still young.

264
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,204
ROYCE: He's 13.
Boys go to war at 13.

265
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,806
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

266
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,008
The gift of a great name.

267
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,642
Sometimes that's all one needs.

268
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,965
(GROANS LOUDLY)

269
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,490
Good-bye, Lord Royce,
and thank you for all you've done for me.

270
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,961
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

271
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,405
I have no doubt that on my return,

272
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,131
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

273
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,365
He'll be safe here.

274
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,248
As for his skills,

275
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,727
I make no promises.

276
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,682
Will we head north at some point?

277
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,287
He said Sansa had a
brother at Castle Black.

278
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,647
We're a few days' ride
from the King's Road.

279
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,087
- But that will take us...
- Us?

280
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,126
The only reason you're here

281
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,090
is because Jaime Lannister
told me you weren't safe in the capital.

282
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,164
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

283
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,163
No one knows what you look like.

284
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,244
No one cares. You're safe.

285
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,085
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know what a squire is?

286
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,407
An attendant to a knight.

287
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,045
I'm not a knight.

288
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,248
That means you're not a squire.

289
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,641
Well, where would I go?

290
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,371
I don't care. I'm not your mother.

291
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,083
You swore to find the Stark girls.

292
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,846
I found Arya. She didn't
want my protection.

293
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,161
- Sansa still might.
- Will you shut your mouth?

294
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,282
I didn't ask for your advice.

295
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,047
I don't want anyone following me.
I'm not a leader.

296
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,486
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord I believed in.

297
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,801
The good lords are dead,
and the rest are monsters.

298
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,161
(HORSES NEIGHING)

299
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,846
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

300
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,285
I did.

301
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,085
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

302
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,288
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

303
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,523
Lord Royce might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

304
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,807
but he's not alone in that castle.

305
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,925
Do you trust all those knights and ladies,
stable boys and serving girls?

306
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,163
No, do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

307
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,084
No. (CHUCKLES)

308
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,921
But I pay them well,

309
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,446
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

310
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,646
So where are we going?

311
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,247
To a land where you trust everyone?

312
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,971
To a land so far from here,

313
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,930
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

314
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,207
It was such a deep, deep shock to us all.

315
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,483
Your father was a...

316
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,370
A force to be reckoned with. He truly was.

317
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,203
I wouldn't presume to claim
to have known him as such, but...

318
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,805
But just being in his presence was enough

319
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,484
to make it so clear

320
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,730
just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.

321
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,562
What a force to be reckoned with.

322
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,287
Thank you so much for your kind words.

323
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,323
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

324
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,564
This tragedy... I never trusted Varys.
I often warned...

325
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,401
Your Grace.

326
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,681
Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.

327
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,001
My deepest sympathies.

328
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,210
I apologize for my son's appearance.

329
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,725
Uncle, that's quite all right.

330
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,405
They call themselves Sparrows.

331
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,289
Bloody fanatics.

332
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,331
Religion has its place, of course,
but at a certain point...

333
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,084
They never would have come
to the capital when Tywin was alive.

334
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,448
I'm sure he'll grow out
of it, whatever it is.

335
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,288
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

336
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,286
Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

337
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,569
It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.

338
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,483
What can I do for you?

339
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,802
You can forgive me.

340
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,406
What could you possibly have done
to warrant my forgiveness?

341
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,167
I led you into the darkness.

342
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,726
I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.

343
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,610
I tempted you into our...

344
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,125
unnatural relations.

345
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,648
And, of course, there was the king,

346
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,648
his boar hunt.

347
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,327
His wine.

348
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,481
I don't know what you're talking about.

349
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,282
I'm a different person now.

350
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,684
I've found peace in the light of the Seven.

351
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,246
You can, too.

352
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,166
They watch over all of us,
ready to dole out mercy

353
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,921
or justice.

354
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,762
Their world is at hand.

355
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,005
I will pray for your father's soul.

356
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,531
(LAUGHS)

357
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,561
The day Tywin Lannister's soul
needs your help...

358
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,446
- OLYVAR: It looks like Dorne.
- LORAS: it doesn't.

359
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,521
(OLYVAR LAUGHS)

360
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,880
It does.

361
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,730
That's the Sunspear bit, right there.

362
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,405
And that's where the mountains are.

363
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,562
And over here is...

364
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,806
ls Sunsnake?

365
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,207
Stonespear?

366
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,884
Sandstone.

367
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,450
Yes.

368
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,761
Yes, Sandstone.

369
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,561
Just there.

370
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,286
Fine.

371
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,725
It's Dorne.

372
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,924
We should go there.

373
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,649
I think we would have a lovely time,

374
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,808
Judging by my experience.

375
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,881
That would be wonderful.

376
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,561
Dorne, Highgarden.

377
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,809
Anywhere but here.

378
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,450
We're late for dinner as it is.

379
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,927
You're very respectful.

380
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,809
I'm very hungry-

381
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,410
What's your name?

382
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,810
Olyvar, my lady.

383
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,126
I'm afraid my brother
is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.

384
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,931
My lady.

385
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,320
Perhaps you might consider
being a bit more discreet?

386
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,004
Why?

387
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,048
They all know about me anyway.

388
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,489
Everybody knows everything about everyone.

389
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,608
What's the point in trying to
keep a secret in a place like this?

390
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,729
In any event,
you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.

391
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,170
My intended? Please.

392
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,931
Tywin's dead.

393
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,968
That means no one
can force Cersei to marry me.

394
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,929
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

395
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,162
You think I want that woman
married to my brother?

396
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,006
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

397
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,208
Which means she stays in King's Landing.

398
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,366
Which means you're trapped here with
Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.

399
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,681
Perhaps.

400
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,841
Perhaps?

401
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,049
Perhaps.

402
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,291
Eunuch, the spider, the
Master of Whisperers.

403
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,967
Imp, half man.

404
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,209
There are faster ways to kill yourself.

405
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,243
Not for a coward.

406
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,369
You are many things, my friend,
but not a coward.

407
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,881
You never told me why

408
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,366
you set me free.

409
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,522
Your brother asked me to.

410
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,004
Could have said no.

411
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,367
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

412
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,681
Not as dangerous as releasing me.

413
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,321
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

414
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,324
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

415
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,767
I didn't do it for you.

416
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,842
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

417
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,163
A drunken dwarf will never be
the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.

418
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,288
I don't believe in saviors.

419
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,802
I believe men of talent
have a part to play in the war to come.

420
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,330
You're going to have to
find another soldier.

421
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,205
I'm done with Westeros,
and Westeros is done with me.

422
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,811
You have many admirable qualities,
self-pity is not one of them.

423
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,402
Any fool with a bit of luck
can find himself born into power.

424
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,280
But earning it for
yourself, that takes work.

425
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,571
I'm not well-suited for work.

426
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,051
I think you are.

427
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,805
You have your father's
instincts for politics,

428
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,041
and you have compassion.

429
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,407
Compassion? Yes.

430
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,843
I killed my lover with my bare hands.

431
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,810
I shot my own father with a crossbow.

432
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,849
I never said you were perfect.

433
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,804
What is it you want exactly?

434
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,370
Peace.

435
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,810
Prosperity.

436
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,203
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

437
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,521
Where the castles are made of gingerbread,

438
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,171
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

439
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,602
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

440
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,001
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

441
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,923
Perhaps.

442
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,245
And perhaps we've grown so used to horror,
we assume there's no other way.

443
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,762
If you sat on the Iron Throne,

444
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,127
would you spread misery
throughout the land?

445
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,931
I will never sit on the Iron Throne.

446
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,764
No, you won't.

447
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,971
But you could help another climb
those steps and take that seat.

448
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,884
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger than Tommen,

449
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,281
but gentler than Stannis.

450
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,762
A monarch who can intimidate
the high lords and inspire the people.

451
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,847
A ruler loved by millions with a
powerful army and the right family name.

452
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,202
Good luck finding him.

453
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,367
Who said anything about "him"?

454
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,408
You have a choice, my friend.

455
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,202
You can stay here at Illyrio's palace
and drink yourself to death,

456
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,807
or you can ride with me to Meereen,
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

457
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,406
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

458
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,841
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

459
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,084
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

460
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,164
Looks like your friends
haven't been behaving themselves.

461
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,004
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

462
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,367
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

463
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,002
to a council of elders made up of both
the freed men and the former slaveholders.

464
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,129
All matters of consequence
will be brought to you for review.

465
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,850
Good.

466
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,445
They did ask for some concessions.

467
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,891
Concessions?

468
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,122
Politics is the art of
compromise, Your Grace.

469
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,090
I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.

470
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,211
HIZDAHR: Forgive me.
You're right, of course.

471
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,166
Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects
than angry ones.

472
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,802
DAENERYS: I don't expect the
Wise Masters to be happy.

473
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,123
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

474
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,124
They do not ask for the return of slavery.

475
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,885
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

476
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,405
DAENERYS: The fighting pits?

477
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,006
Where slaves fought slaves to the death?

478
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,165
In the new world that you've brought to us,
free men would fight free men.

479
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,122
The pit fighters you liberated
pled for this opportunity.

480
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,643
Bring some here and ask them yourself.

481
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,721
No fighting pits.

482
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,321
Opening them would
show the people of Yunkai and Meereen

483
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,970
that you respect their traditions.

484
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,084
I do not respect
the tradition of human cockfighting.

485
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,247
If you...

486
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,607
How many times must I say no
before you understand?

487
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,405
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

488
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,926
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

489
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,240
DAARIO: You should reopen
the fighting pits.

490
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,290
What?

491
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,886
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

492
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,286
She liked to drink pear brandy.

493
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,930
The older she got,

494
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,004
the less she made selling her body,
the more she wanted to drink.

495
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,764
So one day when I was 12,

496
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,003
she sold me to a slaver
she fucked the night before.

497
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,044
I'm sorry.

498
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,771
Why? I was a bad child.

499
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,647
I wasn't big, but I was quick

500
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,926
and I loved to fight.

501
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,289
So they sold me to a man in Tolos
who trained fighters for the pits.

502
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,806
I had my first match when I was 16.

503
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,605
You were sold into slavery,

504
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,126
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,

505
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,282
- and you're defending the fighting pits?
- (LAUGHS)

506
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,330
I'm only here because of those pits.

507
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,721
I learned to fight like
a Dothraki screamer,

508
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,451
a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight.

509
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,846
Soon I was famous.

510
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,925
Ten thousand men and women screamed
my name when I stepped into the pit.

511
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,971
I made so much money for my master,
he set me free when he died.

512
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,528
I joined the Second Sons,

513
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,250
and then I met you.

514
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,203
You're the queen.

515
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,681
Everyone's too afraid
of you to speak truth.

516
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,247
Everyone but me.

517
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,402
You've made thousands of enemies
all across the world.

518
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,165
As soon as they see weakness,

519
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,924
they'll attack.

520
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,842
Show your strength here, now.

521
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,161
That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

522
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,446
(SCOFFS)

523
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,923
Anyone with a chest full of gold
can buy an army of Unsullied.

524
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,046
You're not the Mother of Unsullied.

525
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,650
You're the Mother of Dragons.

526
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,765
I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

527
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,126
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

528
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,131
For all I know,
he's flown halfway across the world.

I can't control them anymore.

530
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,284
A dragon queen with no dragons

531
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,162
is not a queen.

When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

And now, for our last meeting...

544
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,567
This doesn't have to be our last meeting.

545
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,166
No, but it will be.

546
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,961
You know what Stannis wants?

547
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,520
He wants me to bend the knee.

548
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,967
And he wants the free
folk to fight for him.

549
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,130
I'll give him this much, he's bold.

550
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,884
Shouldn't a king be bold?

551
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,805
Oh, aye.

552
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,010
I respect him.

553
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,210
If he gets what he wants,
I expect he'll be a better ruler

554
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,126
than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.

555
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,567
But I'll never serve him.

556
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,725
You told me you weren't here to conquer.

557
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,040
You told me your people have bled enough.

558
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,491
That's right.

559
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,687
I don't want them
bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.

560
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:50,563
You spent your life convincing 90 clans to
come together for the first time in history.

Thenns and Hornfoots,

A life's work uniting them.

You didn't do it for power.
You didn't do it for glory.

565
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,850
You brought them together to save them

566
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,523
because none of them will survive the
winter, not if they're north of the Wall.

567
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,768
Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?

568
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,049
Pride?

569
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,208
Fuck my pride.

00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,568
This isn't about that.

571
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,046
Then bend the knee and save your people.

572
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,128
They followed me because they respected me.

573
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,964
Because they believed in me.

574
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,281
The moment I kneel for a southern king,
that's all gone.

575
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,648
And how many tens of thousands
are out there right now?

How many women?
How many children?

00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,049
And you won't go out
and rescue them because why?

578
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,123
You're afraid of looking afraid.

579
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,530
Oh, I am afraid.

580
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,931
No shame in that.

How will they do it?

They'll burn you alive.

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,208
Bad way to go.

586
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,763
I'll be honest with you.

587
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,002
I don't want to die.

588
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,684
And burned to death?

589
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,607
I don't want people to remember me
like that, scorched and screaming.

590
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,003
But it's better than
betraying everything I believe.

591
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,489
And what happens to your people?

592
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,562
You preserve your dignity and die standing,

593

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,290
why I won't enlist my people
in a foreigner's war,
