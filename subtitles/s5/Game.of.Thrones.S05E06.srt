My stepmother didn't want any rivals
for her precious daughter,

182
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,723
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

183
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,809
He looks strong enough.

184
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,769
What about the dwarf?

185
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,447
Worthless.

186
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,041
Cut his throat.

187
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,646
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
Let's discuss this.

188
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,165
And then chop off his cock.

189
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,331
We'll sell it for a fortune.

190
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,442
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

191
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,846
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, Wait!

192
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,448
You can't just hand a dry cock to a
merchant and expect him to pay for it.

193
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,369
He has to know it came from a dwarf.

194
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,762
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

195
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,604
It will be a dwarf-sized cock.

196
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,603
Guess again.

197
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,883
The dwarf lives until we
find a cock merchant.

198
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,731
(EXHALES)

199
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,602
Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.

200
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,763
We're bound for Volantis, not Slaver's Bay.

201
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,326
Besides, she reopened the fighting pits.

202
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,165
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

203
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,569
TYRION: The fighting pits in Meereen?

204
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,081
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

205
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,969
You are looking at one of the great
warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.

206
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,126
(LAUGHS)

207
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,201
Him.

208
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,041
Him?

209
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,842
He's got to be 60 years old.

210
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,929
Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth,
a bit withered, been in the sun too long.

211
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,891
We can all see that.
But he is a veteran of 100 battles.

212
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,122
They wrote songs about him.

213
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,880
That true?

214
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,209
He won the tournament at Lannisport,
unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.

215
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,361
(LAUGHS)

216
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,446
The Kingslayer.

217
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,683
Jousting. You're talking about jousting.

218
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,286
A fancy game for fancy lads.

219
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,931
The men who fight in the pits of Meereen
will swallow him whole.

220
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,571
JORAH: I killed a Dothraki bloodrider
in single combat.

221
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,846
Liar.

222
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,651
It's no lie. His name was Qotho.

223
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,041
He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.

224
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,606
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

225
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,886
I'll prove my worth.

226
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,286
(LAUGHING)

227
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,920
- (SEAGULLS SCREECHING)
- (BELL RINGING)

228
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,083
For my children. Money.

229
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,767
Lord Baelish.

230
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,887
Yes?

231
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,408
Lancel Lannister.

232
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,529
Brother Lancel.

233
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,011
We abandon our family names.

234
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,844
That's quite a family to abandon.

235
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,090
The city has changed
since you were here last.

236
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,924
We flooded the gutters with wine,

237
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,680
smashed the false idols,

238
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,569
and set the godless on the run.

239
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,447
Well done.

240
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,328
I'm here on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

241
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,001
Should I send word that I'll be delayed?

242
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,730
Step carefully, Lord Baelish.

243
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,691
You'll find there's little tolerance for
flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing.

244
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,730
We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel.

245
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,246
Mine just happen to be entertaining.

246
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,331
Do you think it's wise, Your Grace,

247
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,565
arresting the heir to Highgarden?

248
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,405
The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.

249
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,529
Of course, and the Faith
were armed on your orders.

250
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,290
The king's orders.

251
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,488
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras' perversion?

252
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,483
House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.

253
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,808
House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

254
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,728
I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish.

255
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,327
Ser Loras was promised to me.
Instead, he chose the company of boys.

256
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,687
One's choice of companion
is a curious thing.

257
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,001
Most curious.

258
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,602
Lysa Arryn, for instance.

259
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,444
A thoroughly repellant woman.

260
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,330
Forgive me.

261
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,763
I know you're still in mourning.

262
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,570
Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.

263
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,291
She was neither of those things.
We both know it.

264
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,169
Still, I pity her son.

265
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,209
How fortunate the young Lord of the Vale
has a new father to counsel him.

266
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,521
I know how hard it can be

267
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,967
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

268
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,010
If war comes to Westeros, will the
Knights of the Vale fight for their king?

269
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,606
Young Lord Robin heeds my advice,

270
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,564
and I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

271
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,211
Good.

272
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,525
If there's nothing else.

273
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,690
There is another matter, Your Grace.

274
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,286
Something so urgent
I couldn't trust the words to a raven.

275
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,251
You once charged me with
finding Arya Stark.

276
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,363
To my shame, I failed you.

277
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,409
But I have found Sansa Stark.

278
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,842
Alive and well and home again

279
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,001
living at Winterfell.

280
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,289
That's not possible.

281
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,647
My sources are well placed.

282
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,489
They tell me Roose Bolton
plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay,

283
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,040
a bastard recently legitimized
by King Tommen.

284
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,847
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North
by the grace of my father.

285
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,891
Indeed, his reward
for stabbing his own king in the heart.

286
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,481
We were fools to trust a turncloak.

287
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,526
Marrying his son to the last of the Starks
gives him more legitimacy in the North

288
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,762
than an alliance with a
hated southern house.

289
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,166
I will skin him and his bastard
like that wretch on their bloody sigil.

290
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,890
I would counsel patience, Your Grace.

291
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,485
Patience?

292
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,691
Sansa helped murder my son.
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

293
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,646
Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor,
marching with his army on Winterfell.

294
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,646
Let Stannis and Roose battle.

295
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,563
Let the enemies of the throne
slaughter each other.

296
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,361
And when they're done, seize Winterfell
from whichever thief survives.

297
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,002
Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here.
The weather has already begun to turn.

298
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,529
That is why it is critical to strike soon,
while the victor still licks his wounds.

299
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,407
Surely your Uncle Kevan
could muster a force.

300
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,723
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage
of a kitchen mouse.

301
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,165
Ser Jaime, then.

302
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,084
Jaime's away
on a sensitive diplomatic mission.

303
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,927
I have no idea when he'll be back.

304
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,650
Perhaps I can help.

305
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,882
The Knights of the Vale
are some of the best fighters in Westeros,

306
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,928
trained to battle in the ice and the snow.

307
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,968
Forgive me, Lord Baelish,

308
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,648
you have a reputation as a moneylender
and a brothel keeper, not a military man.

309
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,203
You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier
or a single coin from the royal treasury.

310
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,280
What do you have to lose?

311
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,689
A brothel keeper?

312
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,280
And if you succeed?

313
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,408
Name me Warden of the North.

314
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,328
I'll speak to the king this evening,

315
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,562
have him issue a royal decree.

316
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,605
I'll not rest until the
lion flies over Winterfell.

317
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,887
I'll know you're a man of your word

318
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,804
when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.

319
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,927
As I said,

320
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,849
I live to serve.

321
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,526
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

322
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,843
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

323
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,764
We've waited long enough.

324
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,801
I want you to be my wife.

325
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,291
Now.

326
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,767
What is it?

327
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,643
Do you want to marry me
because our families arranged it?

328
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,051
Or do you...

329
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,441
We can't. Not yet.

330
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,567
Why not?

331
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,762
You know why not. Someone will see.

332
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,207
You are going to be my wife.

333
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,080
I am going to be your husband.

334
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,086
We're allowed
to walk through the gardens together.

335
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,683
How many other girls
have you walked through these gardens?

336
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,366
I like the way your eyes go squinty
when you're jealous.

337
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,966
They do not go squinty,
and you didn't answer the question.

338
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,208
DORAN: They make a lovely couple.

339
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,881
A Lannister and a Martell.

340
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,889
They have no idea how dangerous that is.

341
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,329
We must protect them.

342
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,289
Yes, my prince.

343
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,770
You haven't had to use
that ax of yours in a long time.

344
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,165
I hope you remember how.

345
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,763
I remember how.

346
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,401
BRONN: (SINGING) The Dornishman's
wife was as fair as the sun

347
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,451
And her kisses were warmer than spring

348
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,690
The Dornishman's blade
it was made of black steel

349
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,809
And its kiss was a terrible thing

350
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,007
The Dornishman's wife
Would sing as she bathed

351
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,887
In a voice that was sweet as a peach...

352
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,564
All right, that's enough.

353
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,404
I'm coming to the best part.

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,121
Tommen.

532
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,367
Tommen!

533
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,127
You can't do this. I am the queen.

534
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,801
Tommen! Tommen!

535
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,884
I am your queen. How dare you?
Take your hands off me!

536
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,449
(SHOUTING) Tommen!

(WIND WHISTLING)

539
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,087
What do you want?

540
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,929
Lord Ramsay sent me
to draw your bath, my lady.

541
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,931
You want to be clean and fresh
for your new husband, don't you?

542
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,324
You're so beautiful,

543
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,804
but you need to keep him happy.

544
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,601
Ramsay gets bored easily.

545
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,245
You don't want to end up like...

546
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,966
Well, like the others.

547
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,490
What others?

548
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,960
I shouldn't gossip.

549
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,490
Oh, it's good to see the red again.

550
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,245
No point hiding anymore.

551
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,810
What others?

552
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,681
Let's see, there was Kyra,
the blacksmith's daughter.

553
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,286
She was tall like you, lovely figure.

554
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,809
But she talked and talked and talked,

555
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,088
and Ramsay grew tired of that.

556
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,409
Then there was Violet.

557
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,131
She had gorgeous blonde hair.

558
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,090
But she got pregnant.

559
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,010
And, well, that was boring.

560
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,766
Then Tansy.

561
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,649
Such a sweet girl.

562
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,681
Of course, sweet girls get a bit dull

563
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,728
after a while, don't they?

564
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,207
Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.

565
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,486
Hunt?

566
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,721
Mmm.

567
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,886
Have you ever seen a body
after the dogs have been at it?

568
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,604
Not so pretty.

569
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,207
But, well, it's your wedding day.

570
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,321
Why am I talking about such things?

571
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,290
What was your name again?

572
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,885
Myranda.

573
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,884
And how long have you loved him, Myranda?

574
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,365
Did you imagine that he would
be with you forever, is that it?

575
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,329
And I came along and ruined it.

576
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,325
I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell.

577
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,291
This is my home, and you can't frighten me.

578
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,927
Are you done with your bath, my lady?

579
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,411
Go. I can finish on my own.

580
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,806
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

581
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,406
Yes?

582
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,091
I've come to escort you
to the godswood, my lady.

583
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,730
If you please, my lady,
will you take my arm?

584
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,881
No.

585
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,811
Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.

586
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,166
I'm not touching you.

587
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,811
Please.

588
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,211
He'll punish me.

589
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,806
You think I care what he does to you?

590
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,801
Who comes before the Old Gods this night?

591
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,084
THEON: Sansa of the House Stark

592
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,250
comes here to be wed.

593
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,245
A woman grown, trueborn and noble.

594
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,891
She comes to beg the blessings of the gods.

595
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,251
Who comes to claim her?

596
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,164
Ramsay of House Bolton.

597
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,848
Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell.

598
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,290
Who gives her?

599
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,242
Theon of House Greyjoy, who was...

600
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,404
Who was her father's ward.

601
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,128
Lady Sansa, will you take this man?

602
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,084
I take this man.

603
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,529
Are you pleased, my lady?

604
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,604
Good. I want you to be happy.

607

Uh, yes.

608
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,891
Why?

609
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,648
Why are you still a virgin?

610
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,560
Afraid of dwarves? (CHUCKLES)

611
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,369
Lord Tyrion was kind.

612
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,762
He was gentle. He never touched me.

613
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,051
You're not lying to me?

614
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,006
SANSA: No, my lord.

615
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,401
Lying to your husband on his wedding night,

616
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,130
that would be a bad way
to start a marriage.

617
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,123
We're man and wife now.

618
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,686
We should be honest with each other.

619
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,966
Don't you think?

620
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,765
Yes.

621
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,600
Good.

622
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,765
Take off your clothes.

623
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,690
Oh, no, no, no.

624
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,524
You stay here, Reek.

625
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,965
You watch.

626
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,808
Do I need to ask a second time?

627
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,129
I hate asking a second time.

628

Reek.

629
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,843
I told you to watch.

630
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,565
You've known Sansa since she was a girl.

631
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,849
Now watch her become a woman.
