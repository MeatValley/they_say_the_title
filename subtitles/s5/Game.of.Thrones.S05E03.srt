a suitable bride.

178
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,164
And as it happens,

179
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,483
I've found the perfect girl
to solidify our hold on the North.

180
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,125
SANSA: That's Moat Cailin.

181
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,647
Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?

182
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,961
You've been here before?

183
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,045
On our way down to King's Landing
with my father and Arya.

184
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,041
Where are you taking me?

185
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,645
Home.

186
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,244
The Boltons have Winterfell.

187
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,281
Your marriage proposal, it wasn't for you.

188
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,641
No.

189
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,324
Roose Bolton murdered my brother.
He betrayed my family.

190
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,925
He did.

191
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,889
He serves the Lannisters.

192
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,325
For now.

193
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,687
- I won't go.
- Winterfell is your home.

194
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,240
- Not anymore.
- Always.

195
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,324
You're a Stark.
Dying your hair doesn't change that.

196
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,247
You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving child
of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

197
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,651
Your place is in the North.

198
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,884
I can't marry him. You can't make me.
He is a traitor. A murderer!

199
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,928
You're not marrying Roose Bolton.

200
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,447
No, you'll be marrying
his son and heir, Ramsay.

201
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,369
One day he'll be Warden of the North
and you...

202
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,726
- No.
- Sansa.

203
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,522
No, you can't make me. I will starve myself.
I will die before I have to go there.

204
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,888
I won't force you to do anything.

205
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,566
Don't you know by now
how much I care for you?

206
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,966
Say the word and we turn the horses around,
but listen to me.

207
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,644
Listen.

208
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,809
You've been running all your life.

209
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,851
Terrible things happen to your family
and you weep.

210
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,049
You sit alone in a darkened room
mourning their fates.

211
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,523
You've been a bystander to tragedy
from the day they executed your father.

212
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,171
Stop being a bystander. Do you hear me?

213
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,446
Stop running.

214
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,961
There's no justice in the world.

215
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,249
Not unless we make it.

216
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,724
You loved your family.

217
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,487
Avenge them.

218
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,446
(HORSE NEIGHS)

219
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,885
MAN: Banners!

220
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,770
PODRICK: How do we get through there?

221
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,006
BRIENNE: We don't.

222
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,970
We go around.

223
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,520
Takes us miles out of the way.

224
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,840
We'll lose sight of them.

225
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,969
BRIENNE: Doesn't matter.
I know where they're going.

226
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,281
Aren't you getting a bit
old to be a squire?

227
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,568
How did you end up squiring for the Imp?

228
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,447
He hates that nickname.

229
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,887
Well, he's not here to complain about it,
is he?

230
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,241
I squired for a knight named Ser Lorimer
during the War of the Five Kings.

231
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,483
One night, he had a bit too much to drink,

232
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,166
and he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

233
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,321
He borrowed it?

234
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,686
He wasn't a thief.

235
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,041
He was drunk, and hungry,
and he wasn't thinking.

236
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,368
I was drunk, too.

237
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,487
He gave me half the ham.

238
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,646
Next morning,
one of the guards saw him passed out

239
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,691
under a wagon
with the hambone still in his hand.

240
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,729
They hanged him that afternoon.

241
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,280
They tied the noose for me, too,

242
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,405
but Lord Tywin heard
my family name was Payne,

243
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,766
so he pardoned me,

244
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,320
and sent me to King's Landing
to squire for his son.

245
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,722
As punishment for both of you.

246
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,689
It didn't seem that way.

247
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,524
Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

248
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,921
Yes, all your lords have
been very kind to you.

249
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,684
All except me.

250
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,127
Sorry, you had to squire
for such a nasty person.

251
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,282
I'm not sorry.
You're the best fighter I've ever seen.

252
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,845
You beat the Hound.

253
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,002
I'm proud to be your squire.

254
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,281
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

255
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,681
If you didn't snap at me,
I wouldn't learn anything.

256
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,561
You want to be a knight, Pod?

257
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,721
Yes.

258
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,565
Starting tomorrow,
we'll train with the sword twice a day,

259
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,246
before we ride in the morning
and after you make camp in the evening.

260
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,044
And I'm going to show you
how to ride properly.

261
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,121
Thank you.

262
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,601
I can't knight you,
but I can teach you how to fight.

263
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,523
I suppose that's more important.

264
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,202
You weren't a knight,

265
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,045
but you were a Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

266
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,605
I was.

267
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,001
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

268
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,520
He was.

269
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,804
How did you end up serving Renly?

270
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,211
When I was a girl, my father held a ball.

271
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,966
I'm his only living child,
so he wanted to make a good match for me.

272
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,611
He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.

273
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,490
I didn't want to go,
but he dragged me to the ballroom.

274
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,643
And it was wonderful.

275
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,601
None of the boys noticed
how mulish and tall I was.

276
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,648
They shoved each other
and threatened to duel

277
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,007
when they thought it was
their turn to dance.

278
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,449
They whispered in my ear

279
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,161
how they wanted to marry me
and take me back to their castles.

280
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,523
My father smiled at me,
and I smiled at him.

281
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,287
I had never been so happy.

282
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,881
Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering.

283
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,365
And then they all started to laugh.

284
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,489
They couldn't keep
the game going any longer.

285
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,244
They were toying with me.

286
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,281
"Brienne the Beauty," they called me.
Great joke.

287
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,527
And I realized I was the
ugliest girl alive.

288
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,450
A great lumbering beast.

289
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,766
I tried to run away,
but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.

290
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,450
"Don't let them see your
tears," he told me.

291
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,363
"They're nasty little shits,

292
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,330
"and nasty little shits
aren't worth crying over."

293
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,887
He danced with me, and none of
the other boys could say a word.

294
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,128
Renly was the king's brother after all.

295
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,404
But wasn't he...

296
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,244
Lord Tyrion said he was...

297
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,123
Yes, Pod, he liked men. I'm not an idiot.

298
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,889
He didn't love me. He didn't want me.

299
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,681
He danced with me because he was kind,
and didn't want to see me hurt.

300
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,644
He saved me from being a joke.

301
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,281
From that day until his last day.

302
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,247
And I couldn't save him in return.

303
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,401
Nothing's more hateful
than failing to protect the one you love.

304
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,682
One day I will avenge King Renly.

305
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,607
But you said a shadow murdered him.

306
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,727
How do you fight a shadow?

307
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,287
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

308
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,646
I know it was Stannis.
I know it in my heart.

309
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,842
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

310
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,526
And a man can be killed.

311
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,441
- Lord Commander.
- Your Grace.

312
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,363
I'd like to speak alone.

313
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,681
Olly is my steward now,

314
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,047
as I was Lord Commander Mormont's.

315
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,526
I want him to attend my meetings
to learn from men with experience.

316
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,728
One day he might command.

317
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,361
Very well.

318
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,608
Have you considered my offer?

319
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,286
I have.

320
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,448
And I thank you for it.
You do me great honor.

321
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,961
All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.

322
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,605
Say the word and you will be.

323
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,330
But I have to refuse you.

324
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,406
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

325
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,131
My place is here.

326
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,090
I'm giving you the chance
to avenge your family,

327
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,691
to take back the castle where you grew up.

328
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,842
To rule the North.

329
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,241
I wish I could fight beside you.

330
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,209
Believe me, I do.

331
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,409
But I swore a sacred vow at the godswood.

332
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,610
I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

333
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,603
You're as stubborn as your father.

334
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,601
And as honorable.

335
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,845
I can imagine no higher praise.

336
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,081
I didn't mean it as praise.

337
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,564
Honor got your father killed.

338
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,443
But if your mind's made up,
I won't try and dissuade you.

339
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,842
May I ask how long you plan
to stay at Castle Black?

340
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,490
Are you bored of us already?

341
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,442
You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.
We will never forget that.

342
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,690
But it's a question of survival.

343
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,411
The Night's Watch can't continue
to feed your men

344
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,211
and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.

345
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,361
Winter is coming.

346
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,645
I know it.

347
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,930
We march on Winterfell within the
fortnight, before the snows trap us here.

348
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,366

As the High Septon of
the Faith of the Seven,

526
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,247
I give voice to the will of the gods and
am their foremost servant in this world.

527
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,290
An insult to me is an insult to the gods.

528
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,530
An assault on my person
is an assault on our very religion.

529
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,170
- You were assaulted?
- I was.

530
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,687
By those fanatics
who call themselves Sparrows.

531
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,924
They humiliated me, they beat me,

532
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,004
they left me naked and bleeding
on the cobblestones.

533
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,650
I am lucky to be alive.

534
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,690
I heard this assault
began in Littlefinger's brothel.

535
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,651
This is a rather shocking thing to hear.

536

and the lowliest amongst us.

may earn the mercy of the Mother.

538
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,606
So, you were ministering
to the needs of these devout prostitutes?

539
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,729
A man's private affairs
ought to stay private.

540

542
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,120
I ask that you protect our faith

543
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,046
by arresting these criminals
and throwing them in the Black Cells.

544
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,920
I ask that you execute their leader,
this so-called High Sparrow.

545
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,288
He's a threat to everything we hold sacred.
If he goes unpunished...

546
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,964
And where do I find this man?

547
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,803

548
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,963
I don't think this is a good idea.

549
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,169
Nonsense, Ser Meryn.
These are deeply religious people.

550

Still, it's meant to.

563
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,684
We're often stuck with the names
our enemies give to us.

564

The notion that we're all equal
in the eyes of the Seven

565
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,602

so they belittle me.

Seven blessings to you, my dear.

568
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,527
It's only a name.
Quite an easy burden to bear.

569
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,523
Far easier than hers.

CERSEI: Why no shoes?

571
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,128
Because I gave them away
to someone who needed them more.

572
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,201
We all do that.

573
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,922
It stops us from forgetting
what we really are.

574
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,731
Is that why you came to King's Landing?

575
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,245
To remind everyone?

576
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,608
Everyone? Hard enough job
reminding myself.

577
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,049
Well, I tell them no one's special, and
they think I'm special for telling them so.

578
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,801
Perhaps they're right.

579
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,164
It would be comforting to believe that,
wouldn't it?

580
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,686
Have the gods sent you here to tempt me?

581
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,525
I hope not.

582
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,611
I had assumed
you'd only come here to arrest me

583
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,523
for that incident with the High Septon.

584
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,886
An unacceptable way
to treat the chosen representative

585
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,611
of the gods in this
world, wouldn't you say?

586
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,047
Hypocrisy is a boil.

587
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,647
Lancing a boil is never pleasant.

Although they could have been
more careful with the blade.

589
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,610
The High Septon came to speak to me today.

590
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,606
He doesn't want me to arrest you.
He wants me to execute you.

591
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,729
I wouldn't presume
to know your thoughts on the matter.

592

My thoughts on the matter
are in line with your own.

593
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,246
The High Septon's behavior was corrosive,
as was his attitude.

594
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,365
Having a man like that reside in the sept
eats away at the faith from the inside.

595
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,803
So now he resides
in the Red Keep dungeons instead.

596
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,962
The faith and the crown are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

597
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,122
One collapses, so does the other.

761

That's because they've never met a queen.
